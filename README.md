## 💬 Words of Appreciation

I'm grateful to have worked with amazing colleagues and clients who have shared their thoughts on our collaboration. Here are some of their testimonials:

✨✨✨

### 👤 Ekaterina Golubeva - Zurich University of Applied Sciences
Date: October 25, 2024

*"Looking for a fast and efficient app perfectly tailored to your needs? It's possible! Thanks to Julien, I now have a custom image classifier that includes all the necessary features for my workflow."

Julien developed this application with essential functionalities that make navigating, classifying, and organizing large sets of images intuitive and efficient. Here’s what he implemented according to my specifications:

Keyboard Navigation: Julien made image navigation seamless by integrating keyboard commands, allowing easy transitions from one image to the next or from page to page using arrow keys.
Clickable Image Selection: Images can be selected with a simple click, featuring clear visual indicators (color or blur) to distinguish selected items.
Integrated Metadata Management: Each image is associated with unique metadata (ID) directly linked to a CSV file, enabling quick export of selections into distinct "yes" and "no" categories.
Session Management: He included a "session restart" button for testing, and all classifications can be saved, allowing work to be resumed exactly where it left off.
Progress Tracking: A progress bar with a precise count shows how many images are left to classify, making the process smoother and more motivating.
User-Friendly Documentation: Julien provided a comprehensive README file on GitHub with clear instructions for running the application on another computer, including NodeJS installation.
Working with Julien was an absolute pleasure; he not only developed these features in under two weeks but also assisted with the setup. His efficiency and expertise made this complex project straightforward and successful.

For anyone looking for a skilled developer who can understand specific needs and deliver quickly, I highly recommend Julien. You can check out his work on GitHub — he’s the developer you need on your team!*
